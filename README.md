# Project 1: Maximum Subarray

## 44-349: Survey of Algorithms

### Execution Instructions

To be completed by the student

### The Problem

Given an array `A` of `n` numerical values (positive and negative) find the values `i` and `j` (`0 <= i <= j <= n-1`) such that the sum of the values from index `i` through index `j` is maximized.
In other words, you want to find `start` and `end` such that the total is the largest for a given array:

```python
total = 0
for i = start..end:
	total += A[i]
```

For example: if `A=[-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]` you sum the values from index `3` through index `6` (`[4, -1, 2, 1]`) the result is 6; no other subarray in the array will be larger.

This problem has applications in data mining, computer vision, and genomic sequence analysis.  For more information see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem

### Your Task

You must implement (in a language of your choosing) two separate ways: using brute force and Kadane's algorithm.
After implementing these algorithms you are to time the execution of the algorithms and compare them.

#### Brute Force

The brute force algorithm is simple: generate all possible start/end index pairs, calculate the sum for each, and determine which returns the largest sum.
Essentially:

```python
# n is number of elements, array is 0 indexed, n-1 is max index
maxsum = A[0]
for i = 0..n-1:
	for j = i..n-1: # only start at i; the max could be a single value
		total = 0
		for k = i..j:
			total += A[k]
		if maxsum < total:
			maxsum = total
return maxsum
```

Depending on your use case it may be appropriate to return the start and end index instead of the max value; for our purposes returning the value is appropriate.

#### Kadane's Algorithm

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem#Kadane%27s_algorithm for more information about this algorithm, including pseudocode.

### Testing Your Code
You must unit test all your code using a standard unit testing library for whatever language you choose.
Some simple/"built in" possibilities:

* Python 3: [`unittest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
* Java: JUnit
* C/C++: [acutest](https://github.com/mity/acutest)

If you use other programming languages you must find an appropriate unit test framework.

It is not sufficient to test only a few hand-generated examples.
You should hand generate at least two examples (at least one is in the Wikipedia article linked above) that you verify both of your solution implementations on.
Additionally you should have one or more tests that generate randomized lists and compare the results between your implementations to be sure you get the same answer.

### Timing Your Code

When you have verified that your code works you must write code to time the execution of your algorithms.
Remember: when timing you should average the runtime over many iterations on the _same array size_.
You should be able to generate and report timings of your code for a variety of values for `n` (array size). 

How you generate your arrays is up to you; remember that the arrays can contain both negative and positive values.  You may also want to use different arrays for the same array size; you should decide how the parameters of your timing.  

It is unacceptable to ask the grader to modify/recompile your code to generate timings for various array sizes; you must either read in this parameter from a file, the keyboard, or the command line (runtime parameter) so it is easy to generate timings.
Alternately you may want to decide all values of `n` you will want to test, and output all timings in a table.
Example output is provided for both scenarios

When you write your report you will be expected to state (and possibly explain) the following:

* The number of iterations you averaged over (large is good!)
* How you generated your input data for timing
* Special considerations (are you comparing special cases? doing anything to your data?)

### Deliverables

Your submission must contain:

* Instructions for running your unit tests
  * If you use a language outside those introduced in the School of CSIS or special packages, you must provide instructions (and potentially a runtime) to run your tests and timing code. (Online REPL environments are acceptable, especially if you're using Swift to practice for the iOS course)
* Instructions for running your timing code for various values of `n` (or the sizes you chose if you went the "table" route)

Modify the section at the top of this file with these instructions

Additionally, you must provide in this repository a file containing your timings for lists of various sizes (Choose at least 10 sizes) _for both algorithms_.
Keep in mind you will be using a plotting utility to chart these; account for that when deciding how to store your timings.

### Sample I/O

I have provided examples of both the tabular and command line argument approach to generating timings; you are not required to do both.

```bash
# Output all timings for paper as a table
